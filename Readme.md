## Objective(Topic for Internal round)
AI-Enhanced Healthcare Diagnostics and Management System Inspired by ZK Medical Billing Platform
## Project Description
Our project is designed to streamline the possible diagnosis of medical conditions by leveraging advanced technologies like machine learning,google cloud services and ai chatbots with a strong focus on accuracy and user experience. Users enter their personal details, including name, email, gender, age, medical history, past surgeries, and current symptoms, through a web interface built with HTML and CSS. This data is then processed by a machine learning clustering model that boasts an accuracy rate of over 95%, predicting the potential disease the patient may have.
The predicted disease is further analyzed by an AI/ML model leveraging Gemini API, which provides personalized lifestyle recommendations aimed at enhancing the patient's overall well-being. A comprehensive report, including the patient's personal information, the predicted diagnosis, and the suggested lifestyle changes, is generated using an integrated Overleaf and Google Collab system and downloaded automatically.

# SIH-Hackathon-Byte-Karma
#Steps to run this project:<br>
1.Download all mentioned files.<br>
2.Create a '.json' key using google cloud services and enable google sheets and drive api.<br>
3.Open the sih.html,sih.css,welcome.html,welcome.css in your VS code. <br>
4.Input your spreadsheet in the sih.html file if needed.<br>
5.Open google collab and connect to a runtime. Add gemini api key if not already added. <br>
6.Upload dataset.csv, sih.tex and your '.json' key in collab.<br>
7.Run the code and then proceed to the next step.<br>
8.Open welcome.html with live server.(If it does not connect to the next page open sih.html with live server first and copy the url and paste in the mentioned space in welcome.html)<br>
9.Enter your data in the website.<br>
